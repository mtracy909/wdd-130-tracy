        People will come to my site because they want to know if 
        they should get a PS5 or an Xbox Series X. They will expect to see a comparison of
        prices, console power, and the pros and cons of each console. The main purpose of the site
        is to inform, and people that visit the site will use that information to buy whichever console
        is better for them. Visitors will come to my site over others because it is the only site
        dedicated to this idea. Other sites have blogs where the author shares their opinion, but my site
        will look better and be easier to understand. Instead of having to read through an entire article,
        visitors to my site will be able to quickly get to the information they are interested in.

        If visitors have more time and want to have more detail about the Xbox Series X, they can
        visit the first child page. This page will only discuss the Xbox Series X, by spelling out what
        is specific to the Xbox, both for good and for bad. It will discuss Game Pass, online play, and
        Xbox exclusive games.

        is specific to the PlayStation, both for good and for bad. It will discuss the DualSense controller
        as well as the many PlayStation exclusive games.

      <h3>Xbox Details</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest selling points for getting an Xbox over a PS5 is Game Pass. With Game Pass, 
        you have access to hundreds of games for only $10 per month. Additionally, for an extra $5 per month, you can use
        Xbox Gold, which lets you use multiplayer. This leads to the other main selling point for Xbox, its 
        exclusives. There may not be many, but for the ones that it does have, most notably Sea of Thieves 
        and Halo, you can play with your friends. Being able to play so many different games with your
        friends is probably the main factor why Xbox users chose it over PlayStation.

      </ul>
      <h3>PS5 Details</h3>
      <p>
        One main difference between the PS5 and the Xbox Series X is its controller. With PlayStation's new 
        DualSense controller, you can feel more immersed in your game than ever before. Instead of a typical 
        vibration, the DualSense uses Haptic feedback, which simulates the feeling of firing a gun or even 
        being hit with rainfall. Another main feature is the adaptive triggers, which can either become 
        harder or easier to pull depending on what actions you are taking in the game. The other main selling 
        point for the PlayStation is the games that are available. PlayStation has far more exclusive games than
        Xbox does, and some of them come out really well. Most notably, there is Spider-man, God of War, and Returnal. 
        There are far more out there, but it would take too long to list them all, so feel free to look up a list 
        of them all.
