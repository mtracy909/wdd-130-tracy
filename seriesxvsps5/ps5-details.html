          One main difference between the PS5 and the Xbox Series X is its
          controller. With PlayStation's new DualSense controller, you can feel
          more immersed in your game than ever before. Instead of a typical
          vibration, the DualSense uses haptic feedback, which simulates the
          feeling of firing a gun or even being rained on. Another main feature
          of the controller is its adaptive triggers, which can either become
          harder or easier to pull depending on what actions you are taking in
          the game.

          The other main selling point for the PlayStation is the games that are
          available. PlayStation has far more exclusive games than Xbox does,
          and many them come out really well. Most notably, the games
          Spider-man, God of War, and Returnal are all PlayStation exclusives.
          There are far more out there, but it would take too long to list them
          all, so feel free to look up a list.
