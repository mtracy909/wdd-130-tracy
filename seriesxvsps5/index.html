          As you can see, the consoles themselves perform pretty similarly. The
          Xbox has a bit more storage and a slightly better CPU and GPU, but you
          are able to get the PS5 for $100 cheaper if you get the digital
          version. In the end, though, most of the differences come from outside
          of the console itself. Visit the other pages to find out more.
